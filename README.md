# pelican-simplesG
A very simple theme for the Pelican static site generator.
An extreme minimalist approach for light websites, based on the default simple theme.

This is my first ever theme. I'm creating it for my own use, as I couldn't find a theme I liked for my site. I'm happy for anyone to just use it/fork it/make a better version of it. If you do, please do let me know as it might help me as well.
